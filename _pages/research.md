    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Governments in the Americas rely on aggressive policing tactics to fight crime, despite scant evidence of impact. While recent studies depict militarized policing as a driver of violence, few governments have reconsidered their use of it. What impact does a restriction on aggressive policing have on violence, and why? This paper examines limits on police use of force and how they can be implemented to reduce both police and civilian violence. I argue that reforms that require internal, non-police oversight can be effective institutional constraints, minimizing police violence. In settings where organized crime is widespread, these limits can have spillover effects and further decrease civilian violence by (1) slowing the territorial diffusion of criminal conflict and (2) making conflict more predictable. I test these claims by examining an abrupt limit on police raids in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I find that limiting raids – militarized police strikes targeting criminal gangs and communities under their control – led to a 66% decrease in police killings and a 58% decrease in homicides. The effects were concentrated in police precincts where rival criminal groups are in close proximity. Limiting raids did not lead police to be more violent during ordinary patrolling duties, and did not affect property crimes. The implication is that restraining police use of force in high-violence settings may save lives and be no worse than hard-on-crime strategies.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    How do changes in mobility impact crime? Using police precinct-level daily crime statistics and shootings data from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, we estimate that extortion, theft, and robberies decrease by at least 41.6% following COVID-19 mandated stay-at-home orders and changes in mobility in March 2020. Conversely, we find no change in violent crimes, despite fewer people being on the streets. To address the relationship between crime and mobility, we use cellphone data and split the precincts into subgroups by pre-Covid-19-related restrictions mobility quintiles. We estimate a similar average decrease in extortion regardless of a precinct’s previous activity level, but find that the decrease in theft and robberies is substantially higher for the more mobile precincts while it disappears for the least mobile precincts. Using daily cellphone mobility data aggregated at the police precinct level, we find that changes in mobility while the stay-at-home order is in place only have a meaningful effect on robberies, which increase in likelihood when a precinct’s mobility ranking is higher than the previous day. Together, these results suggest that the stay-at-home order and associated decline in mobility strongly affected extortion and property crimes while not interfering with the dynamics of violent crime. These findings support the hypothesis that violent and property crime follow different dynamics, particularly where there is a bigger impact of organized criminal groups.

How does criminal governance affect elections? Existing accounts explore the consequences of criminal involvement in politics, but have not thoroughly examined how such groups exert their influence. I argue that criminal groups undermine elections through two mechanisms: (1) gatekeeping prevents rival candidates from accessing voters and (2) corralling influences voter choice. I use a natural experiment that leverages exogenous variation in voter assignment to voting booths and a novel dataset on criminal governance to test my theory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I show that gatekeeping restricts the candidate pool while corralling yields more votes for the local leading candidate. Together, these mechanisms decrease electoral competition. I illustrate the logic underpinning the mechanisms using qualitative data based on interviews and voter complaints. These findings bring together the literatures on clientelism and criminal governance by demonstrating that criminal groups leverage the power they derive from governing to sway elections.

   <summary>Abstract</summary> 
How does criminal group taxation affect participation in elections? I argue that criminal groups that tax public service provision use it as a technology of governance, which gives them a comparative advantage in voter mobilization. I predict that higher levels of criminal taxes on services ultimately lead to higher levels of voter participation, and contrast the service provision mechanism with other mechanisms related to coercive taxation and bottom-up reactions to being taxed. I test this argument in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where there is significant variation in taxation by drug trafficking gangs and by vigilante groups across the city’s favelas (informal settlements). To measure criminal taxation, I machine-coded text summaries of 1.45 million anonymous calls for help, and construct favela-year-level indices of criminal a) protection taxes and b) taxes on services. My empirical strategy leverages exogenous variation in favela resident presence at the ballot box to estimate the effect of exposure to criminal taxation on voting. I find that criminal taxes on services are strongly associated with higher levels of voter participation, but taxes on protection have the opposite effect. Consistent with my proposed mechanism, I find that taxes on service provision enable criminal groups to be more effective brokers, increasing participation.

**Under the Radar: Estimating underreporting of gender-based violence to the police** (with Isabella Montini)  [[paper]({{https://jessietrudeau.github.io}}/assets/pdf/under_the_radar.pdf)] [[policy brief]({{https://jessietrudeau.github.io}}/assets/pdf/gbv_crime_caf_brief.pdf)]

   <summary>Abstract</summary> 
Gender-based violence (GBV) is chronically underreported to law enforcement. Existing research emphasizes individual-level factors, but overlooks how broader police behavior shapes reporting. We argue that police violence has a dual effect by (1) discouraging reporting GBV to the police, while (2) shifting reporting towards third-party channels, when available. We link police records with anonymous call logs to an independent hotline to estimate the relationship between police violence and GBV reporting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our analyses demonstrate that exposure to police violence is associated with a relative decline in reporting to the police vis-a-vis the hotline. We then estimate the causal effect of an exogenous decrease in access to the anonymous hotline. GBV reports to the hotline fell by 45%, but fewer than half of these estimated callers filed a police report instead.  The areas where women were least likely to call the police in the absence of the hotline were those with high police violence. Together these findings demonstrate that police violence incentivizes women to report to alternative channels or, in their absence, to stay silent.

**Venue-based sampling: a practical tool to sample hard-to-reach populations in political science**  [[poster]({{https://jessietrudeau.github.io}}/assets/pdf/vbs_polmeth_poster.pdf)]


<details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary> 
Despite an increasing reliance on survey data, finding and sampling understudied populations remains a serious obstacle in political science research. This is particularly true for studies where we lack a high-quality sampling frame, such as conflict or rural settings, or informal areas in the developing world. This paper offers suggestions for how to find and interview these hard-to-reach groups outside of their homes, using a technique called venue-based sampling. I argue that venue-based sampling is underleveraged in political science, not just as a tool to find people, but also as a technique to improve response quality and, under certain conditions, better protect respondent safety. This paper explains the tradeoffs of using venue-based sampling to find people, to elicit truthful answers, and to conduct a safer survey. This paper illustrates these suggestions with evidence from an in-person survey conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which used a particular type of venue-based sampling -- worksite sampling -- to interview bus drivers and fare collectors about criminal governance in their neighborhoods.

## book project 

**Machine Gun Politics: Why Politicians Cooperate with Organized Crime**

My book project demonstrates that politicians often benefit from—and even seek out—deals with criminal organizations. Public officials’ willingness to engage with violent, illicit actors around elections drives three questions underpinning my research for this book:

- Why would a politician collude with criminal organizations? 
- When do the benefits of collusion outweigh the risks? 
- Which candidates are more likely to strike electoral bargains with criminal groups?
- What are the electoral and welfare consequences of collusion?


I develop a theory of candidate-criminal group cooperation, arguing that striking deals with criminal groups can be an unexpectedly successful electoral strategy for many types of politicians. I explain variation in collusive deal-making between politicians and criminal groups and enumerate two mechanisms through which criminal groups deliver votes: *gatekeeping* and *corralling*. I create an original dataset on criminal governance and leverage a natural experiment to closely examine the returns to criminal-candidate collusion in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My mixed-methods book manuscript draws from 18 months of in-person field research in Rio de Janeiro, dozens of candidate interviews, and an in-person survey with residents of criminally-governed communities using *worksite sampling.*

**Strategic Cartography: How Map-Making Enables or Obstructs Social Inclusion** (with Ana Paula Pellegrino)


<details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary> 
The poor are often excluded from official maps. Developing countries, particularly their urban areas, have massive inequalities in the quality and comprehensiveness of official maps, affecting the unmapped’s access to downstream social services and resources. How does “putting people on the map” affect inequality? Can low-income maps and registries be used as policy tools to counteract the challenges of living in a low-income settlement? 
<br>

This project argues that informal settlement registries are a policy tool that can reduce inequality in low-income areas. We substantiate these claims in a two-step nested analysis. First, we conduct a micro-level analysis of 1,074 neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that were “put on the map” at different points in time. This within-city analysis lets us hold external factors constant and compare development outcomes in different neighborhoods. The rollout of the informal settlement registry began in 1981 and is updated periodically, which also lets us estimate the cumulative effects of “being mapped” over time on inequality. Second, we conduct a meso-level analysis of 152 medium and large cities in Brazil, and the determinants of whether or not they have an informal settlement registry. We use this study to eliminate alternative explanations about the reasons for adoption of an informal settlement registry, and to show how municipal trajectories of poverty and inequality change post-adoption. These two empirical strategies consider variation at the individual, neighborhood, and municipal levels. They show how including informal settlements on the map can change the life trajectory of those living in poverty and be a powerful inequality-reduction tool – if incumbents choose to deploy it.
